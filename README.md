# Maze-Generator-Solver
**Maze Generator and Solver**   

A Python application using Tkinter to create and solve random mazes. Features include customizable maze size, and I am planning on adding real-time generation and steps for solving. Built with threading for seamless performance and a GUI.

# How to use it
In maze.py, on Line 71, you can choose between Queue and Stack frontiers. 
Then, run with: python maze_app.py


# Additional
It is a work in progress and simply practice with Python. There are still errors with real-time generation, and also even map sizes, but they will not be fixed soon, as I am in College and have many project ideas. I do however plan on doing this in C or Rust, to hopefully achieve results faster.

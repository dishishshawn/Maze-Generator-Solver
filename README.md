# Maze-Generator-Solver
**Maze Generator and Solver**   

Python application using Tkinter to create and solve random mazes. Features include customizable maze size, and I am planning on adding real-time generation and steps for solving. Built with threading for seamless performance and a GUI.

It is a work in progress and simply practice with Python. I plan on doing this in C or Rust, to hopefully achieve results faster.
